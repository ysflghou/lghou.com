I am a junior software engineer living in Morocco. I love Football, Swimming. I am eager to learn and improve myself everyday, to be a positive actor in the software engineering, my start doesn't matter now, but I want to finish in the top version of myself.

Currently I am a software engineer at [Société Générale - Africa Technologies & Services](https://africa-technologies-services.sgcib.com/). Engaged in all phases of software development of a web service project used by a wide range of clients. The main stack I am using include the elegant C# language, .NET Framework, Git, GitHub, TeamCity, Microsoft Azure, and Service Fabric.

I created this website to start to my blogging journey, and I hope it's not gonna be a start forever and I will be able to get rid of this paragraph soon.
