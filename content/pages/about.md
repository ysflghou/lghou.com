Happy to have your here ðŸ˜…

Currently, I am a software engineer at [SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale - Africa Technologies & Services](https://africa-technologies-services.sgcib.com/), working on a web service handling millions of requests a day. I'm using C#, .NET Framework, Git, GitHub, TeamCity, Microsoft Azure, and Service Fabric.

In my spare time, I try to explore other technologies and do some freelancing on Upwork.

I'm also available for remote jobs.
