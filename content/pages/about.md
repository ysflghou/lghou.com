<u>Feb 2019 - Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ (6 months)</u>

The goal of my graduation project, was to design and develop a Machine Learning based tool, which detects based on code changes, the tests required for development validation, this will help to reduce the number of tests run after each development.

My internship included:

- Analyzing and extracting historical data (code changes + tests history)
- Preparing and cleaning the data
- Features engineering
- Model selection
- The project was divided into three parts: - Data extraction from the CI server TeamCity and Git history, using C#.
  - Data exploration, Features Engineering and Model Selection, using Python (NumPy, Pandas and ScikitLearn)
  - Deployment of the model (Flask Api + Cmd client).
